#summary The <copyright> Tag

= Introduction =

The `<copyright>` tag identifies the copyright holder of this original character sheet.


= Details =

Every Nerdcules character sheet must have exactly one `<copyright>` tag, which must appear inside the [TagHead <head>] tag. The `<copyright>` tag is fourth in sequence, appearing after the [TagName <name>] tag.

Because a Nerdcules sheet is an XML representation of an existing character sheet, it is considered a derivative work. However, since the aim is to be identical to the original sheet, there are no significant changes, and so it falls under the copyright of the original sheet creator. This is usually the publisher of the game in reference. All publisher that I am aware of give explicit permission to make copies of their character sheets for non-commercial use.

== Example ==

Please see the [TagHead <head>] tag for an example.
