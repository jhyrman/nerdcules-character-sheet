#summary The <set> Tag

= Introduction =

The `<set>` tag defines a collected set of elements (attributes, traits, etc.)


= Details =

Every Nerdcules character sheet must have at least one `<set>` tag. It must appear inside the [TagSheet <sheet>] tag, and the first `<set>` tag must come immediately after the end of the [TagHead <head>] tag. Each `<set>` must have at least one [TagColumn <column>] tag. `<set>` tags cannot be nested.

== Example ==

{{{
<sheet>
  <head>
  </head>
  <set>
    <column>
    </column>
  </set>
</sheet>
}}}
