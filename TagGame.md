# Introduction #

The `<game>` tag identifies which game this character sheet is for.


# Details #

Every Nerdcules character sheet must have exactly one `<game>` tag, which must appear inside the [&lt;head&gt;](TagHead.md) tag. It is the second tag in sequence, appearing after the optional [&lt;system&gt;](TagSystem.md) tag.

## Example ##

Please see the [&lt;head&gt;](TagHead.md) tag for an example.
