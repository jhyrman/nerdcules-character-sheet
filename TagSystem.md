The `<system>` tag describes the system this game was designed under.
This tag is not not currently rendered by the parser; it is for reference only.


# Details #

A Nerdcules character sheet may have one `<system>` tag. This is an optional tag. If it appears, it must be inside the [&lt;head&gt;](TagHead.md) tag, and must be the first tag in sequence.
