# Introduction #

The `<description>` tag provides a short description about this sheet.


# Details #

Every Nerdcules character sheet may have one `<description>` tag. This is an optional tag. It must appear inside the [&lt;head&gt;](TagHead.md) tag, and is sixth in sequence, coming after the optional [&lt;author&gt;](TagAuthor.md) tag.

The value of this tag is rendered as the `<meta>` description, which is commonly used by search engines.

## Example ##

Please see the [&lt;head&gt;](TagHead.md) tag for an example.
